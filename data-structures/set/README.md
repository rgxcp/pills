# Set

### [Linear Search, Binary Search, & Kompleksitas Algoritma - Fundamental Algoritma & Struktur Data #002](https://youtu.be/cxF3wnC7Nbk)

#### Key Points

1. Set => collection-of-elements data type that can't contain duplicated value and it's unsorted.
2. Set is considered as an Abstract Data Type (ADT).
   - ADT => collection of operations, properties, and behaviors that define certain data types.
   - On most programming languages, we need to implement ADT by ourself using basic data types that provided by the language.
3. Set can be implemented using various data types (array for example).
4. Worst case insert operation on set is `N+1`.
5. Adding one additional constraint (can't contain duplicated value) on an array data type will affect its code efficiency for basic insert last element operation.
